Inside the HTML <body> tags, a well-structured document typically includes the following semantic sections:

<header>: This section contains introductory content or navigational links. It usually includes the logo, site name, navigation menu, and sometimes a search form.

<main>: This is the central part of your document. It contains the main content of the page. There should be only one <main> element per document.

<footer>: This section contains footer information about the document or site, such as copyright information, contact links, and additional navigation links.

<nav>: This section is for navigation links. Typically, it’s placed inside the <header>, but it can be used elsewhere as needed.

<article>: This section is for self-contained content that could be distributed independently, like a blog post, a news article, or a forum post.

<section>: This section is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading. It’s used to divide content into sections within the <main>.

<aside>: This section contains content that is tangentially related to the content around it, such as sidebars, callouts, or advertisements.
